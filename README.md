## 🆕 Player Enhancement Layer

The enhancement layer enriches player data with real-world context to fix stale projections and prevent common mistakes:

### Key Features

✅ **Bye Week Detection** – Automatically zeros projections and displays "BYE WEEK - DO NOT START" for players on bye, preventing accidental starts

✅ **Recent Performance Stats** – Fetches last 1-3 weeks of actual performance from Sleeper API and displays trends (L3W avg: X.X pts/game)

✅ **Performance Flags** – Intelligent alerts including:
- `BREAKOUT_CANDIDATE` – Recent performance > 150% of projection
- `TRENDING_UP` – Recent performance exceeds projection
- `DECLINING_ROLE` – Recent performance < 70% of projection
- `HIGH_CEILING` – Explosive upside potential
- `CONSISTENT` – Reliable, steady performance

✅ **Adjusted Projections** – Blends recent reality with stale projections for more accurate start/sit decisions (60/40 or 70/30 weighting based on confidence)

### Example

**Before Enhancement:**
```json
{
  "name": "Rico Dowdle",
  "sleeper_projection": 4.0,
  "recommendation": "Bench"
}
```

**After Enhancement:**
```json
{
  "name": "Rico Dowdle",
  "sleeper_projection": 4.0,
  "adjusted_projection": 14.8,
  "performance_flags": ["BREAKOUT_CANDIDATE", "TRENDING_UP"],
  "enhancement_context": "Recent breakout: averaging 18.5 pts over last 3 weeks",
  "recommendation": "Strong Start"
}
```

The enhancement layer is **non-breaking** and automatically applies to:
- `ff_get_roster` (with `include_external_data=True`)
- `ff_get_waiver_wire` (with `include_external_data=True`)
- `ff_get_players` (with `include_external_data=True`)
- `ff_build_lineup` (automatic)

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/derekrbreese/fantasy-football-mcp-public.git
cd fantasy-football-mcp-public
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Yahoo API Setup
1. Create a Yahoo Developer App at [developer.yahoo.com](https://developer.yahoo.com)
2. Note your Consumer Key (Client ID) and Consumer Secret (Client Secret)
3. Set up your `.env` file with these credentials
4. Complete OAuth flow using the included authentication scripts

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your API credentials:

```env
# Yahoo API Credentials (Required)
YAHOO_CLIENT_ID=your_consumer_key_here
YAHOO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here
YAHOO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
YAHOO_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
YAHOO_GUID=your_yahoo_guid

# Reddit API Credentials (Optional - for sentiment analysis)
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
REDDIT_USERNAME=your_reddit_username
```

**Note**: Reddit credentials are optional. The app will work without them, but Reddit sentiment analysis features will be unavailable. See [Reddit API Setup Guide](docs/REDDIT_API_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### Initial Authentication

**First-time setup:**
```bash
cd utils
python setup_yahoo_auth.py
```

**Re-authentication (if tokens expired):**
```bash
cd utils
python reauth_yahoo.py
```

**Token refresh (when access token expires):**
```bash
cd utils
python refresh_yahoo_token.py
```

The authentication scripts will:
- Open your browser for Yahoo OAuth authorization
- Automatically update your `.env` file (preserving existing variable line positions)
- Automatically update MCP config files (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Antigravity) if they exist
- Display confirmation messages

**Important**: After authentication or token refresh, restart your MCP client to use the new tokens.

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Strategy Weights (Balanced Default)
```python
{
    "yahoo": 0.40,     # Yahoo expert projections
    "sleeper": 0.40,   # Sleeper expert rankings
    "matchup": 0.10,   # Defensive matchup analysis
    "trending": 0.05,  # Player trending data
    "momentum": 0.05   # Recent performance
}
```

### Draft Strategies
- **Conservative**: Prioritize proven players, minimize risk
- **Aggressive**: Target high-upside breakout candidates
- **Balanced**: Optimal mix of safety and ceiling potential

### Position Scoring Baselines
- RB: ~11 points (standard scoring)
- WR: ~10 points (standard scoring)
- TE: ~7 points (standard scoring)
- FLEX calculations include position scarcity adjustments

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The optimization engine targets:
- **85%+** accuracy on start/sit decisions
- **+2.0** points per optimal decision on average
- **90%+** lineup efficiency vs. manual selection
- **Position-normalized FLEX** decisions to avoid TE traps

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
```bash
# Refresh expired tokens (expire hourly)
cd utils
python refresh_yahoo_token.py

# Full re-authentication if refresh fails
cd utils
python reauth_yahoo.py

# Or first-time setup
cd utils
python setup_yahoo_auth.py
```

**Note**: All authentication scripts automatically update your `.env` file and MCP config files. After running any authentication script, restart your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) to use the new tokens.

**Only One League Showing**
- Verify `YAHOO_GUID` matches your Yahoo account
- Ensure leagues are active for current season
- Check team ownership detection in logs

**Rate Limiting**
- Yahoo allows 1000 requests/hour
- Server implements 900/hour safety limit
- Use `ff_get_api_status` to monitor usage
- Clear cache with `ff_clear_cache` if needed

**Stale Data**
- Cache TTLs: Leagues (1hr), Standings (5min), Players (15min)
- Force refresh with `ff_clear_cache` tool
- Check last update times in `ff_get_api_status`
